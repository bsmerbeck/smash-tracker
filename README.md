### 06/23/20 Update
**New Features**

 - üó∫ Stage Selection: add the stage you fought on. Old matches simply state "unknown". This will be improved upon in the coming updates

 - üÖ∞Ô∏è Opponent List Sorting: The opponent list is now sorted a-z to make things easier

 - üóë Remove Match from Dashboard: Simple addition, now you don't have to go to matchups to remove a match

 - üéâ Notifications: These are just small visual indicators, nothing to bother your screen. I'll be adding them as I go along

**Bug Fixes**

 - Mobile Logout: Somehow thelogout button wasn't accessible on mobile

 - Styling: Some general improvements on styling so the app works better on your mobile devices

### Running Smash Tracker

To run Smash Tracker, you'll need to create a Google firebase account. The project uses the following features.

- Authentication: allows email + Google sign in and sign up
- Realtime Database: storing authentication information and all entered data (matches)
- Hosting: hosts the app, so it is accessible online
- Cloud Functions: perform backend operations (creating DB nodes for users on sign up)

```
git clone https://github.com/bsmerbeck/smash-tracker.git
cd smash-tracker
yarn install
```

To set up firebase, refer to the documentation available here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup

Once you've set up your project, create a file `firebase.js` in `/src`.

You'll then need to populate the file with your specific firebase details like so:

```jsx
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
import "firebase/database";

export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-key-here",
  authDomain: "your-app.firebase.app",
  databaseURL: "https://your-app.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-message-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
  measurementId: "your-measurement-id",
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

To deploy changes, you'll need to setup the Firebase CLI: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli
